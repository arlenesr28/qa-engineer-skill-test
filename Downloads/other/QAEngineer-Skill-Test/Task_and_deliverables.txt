Framework Selection
I chose Cypress for this skill test due to its user-friendly nature and ease of management. 
The framework offers a comprehensive and intuitive approach to testing, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers. 
Cypress's official website serves as an extensive knowledge base, providing a wealth of documentation, tutorials, and best practices.
